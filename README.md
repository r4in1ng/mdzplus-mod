# Mini DayZ+ Modification

This is my personal modification for Mini DayZ+ 1.2. I didn't name this mod because this mod was intended for personal use. I uploaded it to GitHub so I can play it on my other device. If you wish, you can call this mod "r4in1ng's MDZ+".

## Changes

- Beautified "data.js" file for easier modding, at the cost of larger file size.
- Updated jQuery to the latest stable version (3.4.1 > 3.7.1). Difference? I don't know.
- Changed the night ambience to be more creepy, taken from MDZ+ Casual Chaos modification by Stealthpro59 (I don't know where it originates from).
- Everything is unlocked, no need to sweat yourself to unlock all of those characters/items/weapons anymore.
- Decreased loot respawn time from 24 hours to 6 hours in-game time.
- Cheaper perk costs (Base: 100 > 50 | Increments: 120 > 50).
- Reduced thirst and hunger rate on all difficulties.
- Increased blood regeneration rate on all difficulties.
- Secret locations are already revealed from the start.
- Modified amount of all buildings, also made the amount consistent across all islands.
- All loot durabilities are changed to 100%.
- Enabled the battle royale game mode item spawning system. Does not include the Bot/NPC spawns.
- Added all items to **most of** the loot spawning table. With the exception of some items listed below:
	- Protector Case
	- Officer's Keycard
	- Mushroom (resets your game data when eaten)

And maybe some other changes that I may forgot to list here...

## Other

- Offline play

Your browser will cache necessary resources when you first load to the game. All you need for offline play is load up the game with internet connection available for the first time, after that you can turn off the internet connection and play the game. This applies the next time you load up the game. Unless, you have cleared your browser's cache.

- "Casul" modification

Sure, you can say that I guess. I made the game a lot easier than it was originally. But hey, what's wrong with having some fun in a singleplayer video game?
